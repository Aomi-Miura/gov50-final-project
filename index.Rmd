## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the political polarization in the US.
Ideally, I would like to investigate how people endorsing right/left-leaning media (newspapers, TV, etc.) have a tendency to reinforce their ideological notions. However, individuals' previously-held ideological notions would be a confounder of the possible causality. Therefore, I wish to adopt "Difference-in-difference" research designs.
